# TinyCalc
TinyCalc is a replacement for the default Windows calculator for those who prefer to only use their keyboard.

##Features

###Minimal
This calculator was designed to be as minimal as possible because no one needs to see all the fancy features of a calculator at once. Plus I believe anyone who would use a calculator such as this already knows what functions they want to use and don't need to see them as buttons.

###Keyboard Exclusive
This program has no mouse support aside from the standard text functions like copying and pasting. This was a deliberate choice because typing into a calculator is much faster than clicking on a calculator. 

###History
The calculator stores and displays a history of previous calculations for reference. The `Up` and `Down` arrows can be used to navigate through the history to select previous equations. The `ans` token can be used to substitute the answer of the most recent calculation, just like a real scientific calculator.

###Autocomplete
Since there are no buttons, autocomplete is a way to hint to users what functions and constants are available for use. Autocomplete appears whenever you change the equation. Use `Ctrl + Space` to force open the autocomplete list.
